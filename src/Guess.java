//IDE: IntelliJ
/*Purpose of Program Summary:
   This program plays a guessing game. The program will print out an introduction, then
   it will create a random number between one and the constant, and the player
   will guess it until they get it correct. If the player guesses incorrectly then
   the program will tell them they guessed incorrectly, then tell them if the correct answer
   is higher or lower than their input and then ask for another number. If the answer
   is correct, then the program will them them the amount of guesses they took to
   get the right answer, then ask if they would like to play another game. If they
   respond with y, then the process repeats. If they respond with n, then the program
   gives them the statistic of the total games the user played, including the number
   of games played, total guesses over all games, average amount of guesses, and
   the high score.
